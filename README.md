Scalar Subqueries

A subquery that returns a single value.

Example use: show each employee’s salary alongside the average salary.

Correlated Subqueries

A subquery that depends on values from the outer query.

Example use: find employees earning more than their department’s average.

Subqueries in SELECT

Place a subquery in the SELECT list to calculate values dynamically.

Subqueries in WHERE

Use subqueries to filter results with conditions (=, <, >, IN, etc.).

Subqueries with IN, EXISTS

IN: Compare a value against a list returned by a subquery.

EXISTS: Check if rows exist in a subquery.

Subqueries in FROM (Derived Tables)

Use a subquery as a virtual table inside the FROM clause.
